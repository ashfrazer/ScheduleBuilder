## Welcome to the Schedule Builder! 

This is full-stack web application that is designed to be an interactive environment in which users can build their semester schedules. The user logs their completed courses, and then enters the number of remaining semesters. Afterwards, they are exposed to the interactive schedule building page.

This is a group project for the course CSCI-3355 Software Design and Construction.

### To run:
- Ensure that Docker is installed
- Execute the *start-services.bat* file
